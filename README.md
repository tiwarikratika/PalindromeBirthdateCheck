# PalindromeBirthdateCheck

<h1> Do you all know what a palindrome is? </h1>
<p> Well, palindrome is basically a string or a number which spells the same as we read it from beginning or ending</p>
For eg: "NAMAN": If we try to read this from start or from the end, it's the same. Therefore it is a palindrome.
OR we can say 11011, This is also a palindrome..

<h2>Have you ever wondered is your birthdate is a palindrome or not? </h2>
Well, even if not , I am sure after reading this question, you might be thinking about it and now you will surely check if it is or not.
